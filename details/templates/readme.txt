Please edit and save templates only in UTF-8 format.
Such editors are common now, but be sure you have/use one.

When you save a template-file first time,
be sure you save it as "UTF-8" text.

UTF-8 is a format of the text, which makes it possible to support 
different human languages.

DPost is proud to be all-languages tolerant.

We look forward to provide example templates in more languages. 

The helper how to develop templates, please read templates.pdf
